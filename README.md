This project is designed to provide students with hands-on experience with the aim of extracting meaningful insights from the NYC Airbnb Open Data. The dataset includes detailed information about Airbnb listings in New York City, covering host details, geographical availability, and essential metrics.

Problem Statement:
Your goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the NYC Airbnb dataset and derive actionable insights for hosts and potential renters. The dataset offers an opportunity to address various problem statements, and one possible focus is predicting rental prices based on relevant features. Additionally, students are encouraged to explore different models and analysis approaches, such as treating it as a regression problem or a classification problem to predict different levels of demand.

Tasks:
- Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns.
- Examine host details, geographical availability, and rental metrics.
- Select relevant features for the predictive model, considering host characteristics, listing details, and geographical factors.
- Formulate the problem statement as predicting rental prices based on the chosen features.
- Experiment with different machine learning models, considering regression or classification approaches.
- Train the predictive models and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics.
- Analyze the significance of different features in predicting rental prices.
- Students are also encouraged to formulate hypotheses related to factors influencing rental prices or demand and conduct hypothesis testing to validate or refute these hypotheses.
- Create visualizations to support findings and enhance the interpretability of the predictive model.
- Summarize results, including key insights, challenges faced, and potential areas for improvement.
